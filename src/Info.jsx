              My background
            </h1>
            <p className="leading-7">
              I started my tertiary education journey in 2018 at the
              University of Queensland, studying a bachelors of biomedical
              science with provisional entry into the doctor of
              medicine. Originally from Sydney, moving interstate by myself was
              a huge milestone in my personal growth. As much as I enjoyed it
              though, my goal was transferring to a medicine program in Sydney.
              I wanted to complete the lengthy degree(s) at home with family and
              friends, and without the pressure of supporting myself interstate.
              At the start of 2019 I was accepted into the medicine program at
              the University of New South Wales (UNSW) with an immediate start.
              At the time I thought I was just at the beginning of a long career
              in medicine.</p>
            <br/>
            <p className="leading-7">
              Come 2021, I realised that a professional career in
              medicine ultimately didn&apos;t align with my long term plans.
              Leaving medicine was a very difficult decision to make, as I had
              to forego pressure from family and escape the the sunk cost
              fallacy. Reevaluating what I wanted to study lead me to starting a
              computer science degree at UNSW in 2022, as I was already very
              passionate about technology and enjoyed problem solving, logical
              thinking, and constantly learning. Ironically I never even
              considered studying computer science out of high school, despite
              my affinity for it. It&apos;s very clear to me that I made
              the right choice - I enjoy every aspect of my computer science
              degree, and am beyond keen to start my career. I&apos;m grateful
              to be truly passionate about this field, and owe much to the
              unending support my partner has given throughout my studies
              (shout out to Madison).

                Outside the realm of computer science I&apos;ve had several jobs
                -
                from private tutoring, to writing for a boutique aesthetics
                consultancy, to working as a day fill team member at my local
                Coles. Across the board I&apos;ve developed strong communication
                skills - both written and verbal - that I leverage to understand
                and engage with any audience.

                Most recently I&apos;ve been
                working as a casual academic at UNSW, tutoring fundamental
                courses in the computer science faculty. In this role I&apos;ve
                been able to utilise my experience in tutoring, communicating,
                and mentoring to help students understand course materials and
                develop their own problem solving skills. This role has been
                very fulfilling for me as it cements the effort I&apos;ve put
                into learning course content deeply, while helping others
                achieve the same.

                Outside of university and work I&apos;ve been up-skilling in
                full
                stack development, exploring:
                <br/>
                - Mobile development via iOS apps built with Swift,
                SwiftUI, and other core Apple technologies like MapKit, Core
                Image
                <br/>
                - Backend development via servers for RESTful APIs built with
                Java, Spring Boot, and relational databases
                <br/>
                - Web development via projects built with both the fundamentals
                of Javascript/HTML/CSS and libraries like React/Tailwind
              </p>

                Full disclosure, the stats provided are padded by
                projects I did for the sake of fully completing some
                certifications (among other things...) - they weren&apos;t
                difficult but did serve as good practice. I&apos;m aware that I
